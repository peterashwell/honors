	\frametitle{Overview}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The observation and analysis of transient events is vital to help astronomers understand our Universe
		\item Modern telescopes are automated and produce enormous amounts of data and present new challenges
		\item The ultimate goal is the complete automation of sky observation
	\end{itemize}
	%	TODO add an image showing how transient astronomy is important or cool or something
	%	Also have an image of time series
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Time Series}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A big issue is the rapid analysis of time series - current methods are too slow
		\item Want to determine as soon as possible if a time series is of interest - enter gaussian processes
		\item Gaussian processes are used to predict the future behavior of a time series given some observed points
	\end{itemize}
	% Images of time series
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{The Paper}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This paper addresses the issue of the speed of regression - the time taken to model data (TODO what)
		\item Previous work had running times of the order of O(n2), where n is potentially very large
		\item list previous important papers, overviews of gaussian process regression
	\end{itemize}
	% List of previous papers relevant and general reading, citations
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{The Results}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Improved running time
		\item Enabling the rapid analysis of astronomical data
		\item Improving the ability of astronomers to understand the universe
	\end{itemize}
	% Simple list of performance iprovements
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Method}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Sparsifying of time series in a way that does not impede regression
		% Flow chart of process}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Review}
	% talk about the practical problems, elegancy, significancy
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Research Plan}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Incorporate this method into the approach to data analysis
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
