PART ONE - TIME SERIES CONSTRUCTION
desc:
need to take the images and form a 2d array of luminosity per source per frame.

problems:
- sources move around (2 arcseconds)
- sources appear and disappear

important:
- measuring distance change requires analysis of spherical coords

implementation:
- use a simple 2d array to store shit
- new sources get a new row in the array filled out to zeros
- disappearing sources that reappear are coorelated to last nearest position
- use some efficient spatial data structure?

PART TWO - ANALYSIS
desc:
given a 2d array of luminosity per source per frame, find the interesting sources.

problems:
- sources move around, may have swapped
- sources appear and disappear
