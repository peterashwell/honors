source 154470912 at tolerance 5 is not appearing in search results... investigation shows that the bounds are too narrow for it to appear... tolerance has to be stretched to 25 or more to get that result...
what to do? weighted search results of flux vs. movement distance? probably

anyway it's not looking good
